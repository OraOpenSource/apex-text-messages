# Apex Text Messages
When running an application and when an error occurs your users will see the message “1 error has occurred”. If you want to translate this message for example in Slovenian or Polish language you must define a Text Message in Shared Components. In this case you create a text message with a name "FLOW.SINGLE_VALIDATION_ERROR", a language code "sl" and a text with Slovenian translation. If you also want to have a Polish translation, then you create a new text message with the same name "FLOW.SINGLE_VALIDATION_ERROR", but with a different language code "pl" and a text with Polish translation. And you have to do this for every application. 

In current release of Oracle Application Express (5.0) there are 462 documented internal text messages. With increasing number of applications and languages, management of text messages must be centralized, consolidated and simplified. 

Purpose of this application is to help you with management of Oracle Application Express internal text messages.
